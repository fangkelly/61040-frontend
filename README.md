# trailMix
trailMix is a social media app for nature-enjoyers and hikers of all experience levels. The app interfaces with Mapbox's directions API to create hiking trails based on existing footpaths. With trails, users can document their own hiking experiences. The app also allows users to coordinate hikes together through the creation of events where a user may propose a hike on a certain date, with certain destinations along the way. Other users may view the event details (including attendees, destinations, estimated distance/elevation), start a discussion, and register.
